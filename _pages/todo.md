# Requirements

The TodoApp will help us memorize somethings we need with priorities.

We can create/edit/remove/rearange/mark done todos.

Our requirements are TodoApp can work on both online and offline.

User can have one or many devices such as an iPhone and an iPad and and Android device.

When user update todo by one device, the other device(s) will change correspondingly.

Based on requrements above, we get some conclusions:

1. App can run on most mobile devices (iOS and Android are majority)
2. App can work on both online and offline
3. App can sync data from offline to online and vice versa
