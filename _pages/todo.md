# Requirements

The todo app will help us memorize somethings we need with priorities.

We can create/edit/remove/rearange/mark done todos.

Our requirements are todo app can work on both online and offline.

User can have one or many devices such as an iPhone and an iPad and and Android device.

When user update todo by one device, the other device(s) will change correspondingly.

Based on requrements above we get some conclusions:

1. App run on both iOS, Android -> cross platform
2. Working on both online and offline
3. Sync data offline to online and vice versa
